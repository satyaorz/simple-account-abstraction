# About

1. Create a basic AA on Ethereum
2. Create a basic AA on zkSync
3. Deploy, and send a userOp / Transaction through them


# notes

- To create a smartcontract on ethrereum all we have to so is sign the transaction including the compiled code and send it to the blockchain, then the blockchain can identify that there is no recipient and consider that sent transaction is a smartcontract

- On ZkSync however, there are multiple functions which we can call while creating a smartcontract
